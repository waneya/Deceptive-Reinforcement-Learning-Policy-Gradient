1: real goal = 0.6, fake foal = 0.4; actions chosen stochastically
2: if agent is confusing more and more in 1, favour real goal by increasing probability further.
3. equal selection changes. In case of confusion favour real goal
4. equal probability for all. In case of confusion favour real goal, when confusion removes becomes deceptive; controlled by pruning parameter
5. equal probability for all. In case of confusion favour real goal, when confusion removes becomes deceptive, limit of favouring real increases by doubling pruning parameter
